# QR Mirror

This is an old project I worked on which, when you took a photo of a printed QR code using your phone, used a network-connected camera to take a photo of you at the moment you captured the QR code -- exhibiting what I refer to as your "QR face."

This version uses a configurable-length frame-buffer and goes back to the approximate moment when your phone read the QR code. When you load the QR code URL, it will send you a picture of yourself taking a picture of the QR code. How meta!

My conclusion is that nine times out of ten, you'll look like an idiot when you're trying to scan a QR code.
